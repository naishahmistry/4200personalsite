    <p class="text" id='main'> 
        My name is Naisha Mistry, and I am a second year Data Science major at Northeastern University. I have been an avid F1 fan since I was introduced to the sport three years ago by my friends
        in high school! From the chaotic driver dynamics to the advancements in marketing and engineering, it is the perfect combination of entertainment, sports, and interdisciplinary collaboration. My favorite team is 
        Ferrari and my favorite driver is Carlos Sainz because of his strategic approach to racing and energetic personality! One of my favorite F1-related memories is when I got to watch the Redbull F1 Showrun during 
        N.U.in Greece and my friend and I got front row seats to watch the championship-winning F1 car do donuts! In the past, I've enjoyed working in organizations that encourage cross-functional collaboration across
        engineering, business, and creative teams, such as my robotics team in high school and FSAE team in college. This inspired me to pursue a career in Data Science and Product Management where I can apply my skills
        to multiple industries and work with numerous teams with unique strengths. In my free time, I also enjoy reading, baking, watching movies/TV (especially sitcoms), playing the guitar, and curating my Spotify.
