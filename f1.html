    <h1 class="header">Intro to F1 and the 2024 Season</h1>

    <p class="text" id = 'main'> F1 is the highest tier of the Formula motorsport series where 10 teams consisting of two drivers compete year-round in 24 races (Grand Prixs) across 21 countries to win the Constructor's and Driver's Championships. 
        At each Grand Prix, drivers participate in 3 free practice rounds, a qualifying session to determine positions at the start of the race, and the actual race. 
        The top 10 drivers are awarded points that contribute to the both championship titles. 
        The Constructor's Championship sums all of the points earned by both drivers in a team and is awarded to the team with the most collective points, while the Driver's Championship compares the points earned by each individual driver and is awarded to the driver with the most points. 
        This creates a strong sense of cooperation and competition among all drivers that makes the sport even more unique beyond the fun personalities of the drivers, engaging paddock activities, and the intense racing on the track. 
        The 2024 season has been notably different from the 2023 season, which was heavily dominated by Max Verstappen, who won the Driver's Championship by a record of 290 points over the second place driver, and his team Redbull, which won all races except for the Singapore Grand Prix. 
        Redbull has still remained dominant this season, but is facing closer competition from teams like McLaren and Ferarri. There have also been seven different race winners in 2024 (Verstappen, Norris, Leclerc, Hamilton, Piastri, Russell, Sainz) compared to only 3 unique winners in 2023 (Verstappen, Perez, Sainz). 
        For some drivers, these wins were very memorable and personal, such as Piastri and Norris finally earning their maiden wins after two and six seasons, respectively, Hamilton winning at his home race after not having won a race for 945 days and breaking numerous records (most wins and podiums at single circuit, most seasons with a victory, oldest F1 race winner in 21st century), Sainz winning two weeks after an appendix surgery that caused him to sit out of the previous race, and Leclerc winning both his home races of Monaco and Monza. 
        Something also unique to this season has been the driver/seat changes for 2025 since most drivers' contracts end this season, as well as the introduction of many rookie drivers and mid-season driver swaps. 
        Regarding 2025 contracts, some major changes will be Hamilton joining Ferrari after being with Mercedes since 2013 and winning all seven of his Driver's Championships with them, Sainz moving to Williams, Esteban Ocon moving to Haas, Oliver Bearman (F2 driver and current reserve driver for Haas and Ferrari) getting his first full-time seat at Haas, and Kimi Antonelli (18-year-old F2 Driver) replacing Hamilton at Mercedes. Bearman and Antonelli made their F1 debuts this season, with Bearman driving for Ferrari and Haas due to existing drivers being injured/penalized, and Antonelli driving in a free practice for Mercedes. 
        Daniel Ricciardo and Logan Sargeant were also removed from their respective teams mid-season and were replaced by former F2 drivers Liam Lawson and Franco Colapinto, respectively, which also gave them major F1 debuts/breakthroughs.
